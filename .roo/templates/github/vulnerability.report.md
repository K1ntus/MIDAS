MIDAS Vulnerability Report Issue Template
========================================
Instructions for Agent (e.g., MIDAS Security Specialist):
- Replace placeholders like '[ ]' with specific information from security scans or code review.
- Be precise about the location and nature of the vulnerability.
- Provide clear evidence and actionable remediation advice.
- Ensure all links are correct.
- Use Markdown formatting appropriately (especially for code snippets).
- The title should clearly indicate the vulnerability (e.g., "[VULN] SQL Injection possible in user search endpoint").
- Assign the 'vulnerability' label upon creation.

# Test Strategy

**Document Version:** [Version Number]

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Introduction

*   **1.1. Purpose:** Define the overall approach, objectives, scope, and methodology for testing the [Project/Product Name] system.
*   **1.2. Scope:**
    *   **In Scope:** What features, components, and quality attributes will be tested? (e.g., Functional requirements, performance, security, usability).
    *   **Out of Scope:** What will *not* be tested as part of this strategy? (e.g., Third-party integrations beyond the interface, specific hardware configurations).
*   **1.3. Goals & Objectives:** What are the primary goals of testing? (e.g., Verify requirements, find critical defects, assess quality, build confidence, ensure compliance).

## 2. Testing Levels & Types

*Describe the different levels and types of testing that will be performed.*

*   **2.1. Unit Testing:**
    *   *Owner:* Developers
    *   *Scope:* Individual functions, methods, classes.
    *   *Tools:* [e.g., Jest, JUnit, pytest]
    *   *Goal:* Verify correctness of isolated code units, target [Specify %] code coverage.
*   **2.2. Integration Testing:**
    *   *Owner:* Developers / QA Automation Engineers
    *   *Scope:* Interactions between components, services, or modules (e.g., API interactions, service-to-service communication).
    *   *Tools:* [e.g., Supertest, Postman (Newman), Spring Boot Test]
    *   *Goal:* Verify interfaces and data flow between integrated units.
*   **2.3. System Testing / End-to-End (E2E) Testing:**
    *   *Owner:* QA Team / QA Automation Engineers
    *   *Scope:* Testing the complete, integrated system from a user's perspective. Simulating real user scenarios.
    *   *Tools:* [e.g., Cypress, Selenium, Playwright]
    *   *Goal:* Validate overall system functionality and user workflows against requirements.
*   **2.4. Acceptance Testing (UAT):**
    *   *Owner:* Product Owner / Business Analysts / End Users
    *   *Scope:* Validating that the system meets business requirements and user needs.
    *   *Method:* [e.g., Manual execution of acceptance criteria, exploratory testing]
    *   *Goal:* Gain confidence and acceptance from stakeholders.
*   **2.5. Performance Testing:**
    *   *Owner:* Performance Engineers / QA
    *   *Scope:* Assessing system responsiveness, stability, and resource utilization under load.
    *   *Tools:* [e.g., k6, JMeter, LoadRunner]
    *   *Goal:* Ensure system meets performance targets (e.g., response time, throughput).
*   **2.6. Security Testing:**
    *   *Owner:* Security Team / QA
    *   *Scope:* Identifying vulnerabilities, ensuring data protection, testing authentication/authorization.
    *   *Tools/Methods:* [e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Penetration Testing, Static/Dynamic Code Analysis]
    *   *Goal:* Identify and mitigate security risks.
*   **2.7. Usability Testing (Optional):**
    *   *Owner:* UX Team / QA
    *   *Scope:* Evaluating ease of use and user satisfaction.
    *   *Methods:* [e.g., User observation, surveys]
    *   *Goal:* Ensure a positive user experience.
*   **2.8. Regression Testing:**
    *   *Owner:* QA Team / Automation Engineers
    *   *Scope:* Re-testing previously tested parts of the system after changes to ensure no new defects were introduced.
    *   *Method:* [e.g., Automated regression suite, targeted manual testing]
    *   *Goal:* Maintain system stability after modifications.

## 3. Test Environments

*Describe the different environments used for testing.*

| Environment Name | Purpose                                     | Owner | Data Source        | Access Control |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---- | :----------------- | :------------- |
| Development      | Local developer testing, unit tests         | Dev   | Mock/Local DB      | Dev Team       |
| CI               | Automated builds, unit/integration tests    | DevOps| Mock/Ephemeral DB  | CI System      |
| QA / Staging     | System, E2E, Performance, Manual QA testing | QA    | Anonymized Prod Copy| QA, Dev        |
| UAT              | User Acceptance Testing                     | PO/BA | Anonymized Prod Copy| Business Users |
| Production       | (Limited testing, e.g., smoke tests)        | Ops   | Live Data          | Restricted     |

## 4. Test Automation Strategy

*   **Scope:** Which test levels/types will be automated? (e.g., Unit, Integration, Regression E2E).
*   **Frameworks/Tools:** [List chosen automation tools/frameworks].
*   **Execution:** How/when will automated tests run? (e.g., CI pipeline, nightly builds).
*   **Reporting:** How will results be reported and tracked?

## 5. Defect Management

*   **Tool:** [e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues]
*   **Workflow:** Describe the process for reporting, tracking, prioritizing, and resolving defects.
*   **Severity/Priority Definitions:** Define levels (e.g., Blocker, Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial).

## 6. Test Deliverables

*List the artifacts produced as part of the testing process.*

*   Test Strategy (this document)
*   Test Plans (for specific features or releases, optional)
*   Test Cases (manual and automated scripts)
*   Test Data
*   Defect Reports
*   Test Summary Reports

## 7. Roles & Responsibilities

*Define who is responsible for various testing activities.*

*   **Developers:** Unit testing, integration testing (shared), defect fixing.
*   **QA Engineers:** Test planning, test case design, manual testing, automation development/maintenance, defect reporting.
*   **Product Owner/BA:** Acceptance criteria definition, UAT execution.
*   **DevOps:** Environment setup, CI/CD pipeline maintenance.

## 8. Risks & Mitigation

*Identify potential risks to the testing process and plan mitigation strategies.*

| Risk                               | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                  |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Lack of adequate test data         | Medium     | High   | Develop data generation scripts, anonymize prod data |
| Unstable test environments         | Medium     | High   | Improve environment monitoring, dedicated QA support |
| Late delivery of features          | High       | Medium | Prioritize critical path testing, risk-based testing |
| Insufficient automation coverage   | Low        | Medium | Regular review of automation scope, dedicated time   |

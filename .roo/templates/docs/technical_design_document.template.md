## 1. Introduction & Goals

*   **1.1. Overview:** Briefly describe the feature or component this document details. What problem does it solve from a technical perspective?
*   **1.2. Goals:** What are the specific technical goals for this design? (e.g., Implement API endpoint X, Create database schema Y, Integrate with service Z).
*   **1.3. Non-Goals:** What is explicitly out of scope for this specific design?

## 2. Background & Context

*Provide necessary background information. Link to relevant requirements, existing architecture documents, or previous designs.*

*   [Link to System Architecture Overview]()
*   [Link to relevant ADRs]()
*   [Link to Product Requirements Document / User Story]()

## 3. Proposed Design

*This is the core section detailing the technical solution.*

*   **3.1. High-Level Design:** Provide a conceptual overview of the solution. A diagram (e.g., component diagram, sequence diagram) is often helpful here.

*   **3.2. Detailed Component Design:** Break down the solution into smaller parts (classes, functions, modules, services, etc.) and describe their responsibilities and interactions.
    *   **Component A:**
        *   Responsibility: ...
        *   Key Interfaces/APIs: ...
        *   Data Structures: ...
    *   **Component B:**
        *   Responsibility: ...
        *   Key Interfaces/APIs: ...
*   **3.3. API Design (if applicable):** Define any new or modified APIs.
    *   Endpoint: `[HTTP Method] /path/to/endpoint`
    *   Request Body/Params: [Schema or example]
    *   Response Body: [Schema or example]
    *   Authentication/Authorization: ...
*   **3.4. Database Design (if applicable):** Describe new tables, schema changes, or data access patterns.
    *   Table Name: `[table_name]`
    *   Columns: [List columns, types, constraints]
    *   Indexes: ...
    *   Queries: [Example important queries]
*   **3.5. Data Flow:** Describe how data moves through the components involved in this design. A sequence diagram can be very effective here.

*   **3.6. Error Handling:** How will errors be detected, logged, and handled? What are the failure modes?
*   **3.7. Security Considerations:** How does the design address security requirements (authentication, authorization, input validation, data protection)?
*   **3.8. Monitoring & Logging:** What metrics or logs should be added to monitor the health and performance of this feature/component?

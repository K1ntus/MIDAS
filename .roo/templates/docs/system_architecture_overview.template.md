# System Architecture Overview

**Document Version:** [Version Number]

**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Introduction

*Provide a brief overview of the system, its purpose, and the intended audience for this document. What problem does the system solve?*

## 2. Architectural Goals & Constraints

*List the key goals that guided the architecture (e.g., scalability, maintainability, security, performance, cost-effectiveness) and any significant constraints (e.g., technology limitations, budget, existing infrastructure, regulatory requirements).*

**Goals:**

*   [Goal 1]
*   [Goal 2]

**Constraints:**

*   [Constraint 1]
*   [Constraint 2]

## 3. High-Level Architecture View (Context Diagram)

*Include a high-level diagram (e.g., C4 Context Diagram, simple block diagram) showing the system's boundaries, its major components/containers, users/actors, and interactions with external systems.*

*Briefly explain the diagram and the main interactions.*

## 4. Key Components / Services

*Describe the major components, microservices, or modules of the system and their primary responsibilities. A C4 Container diagram might be useful here.*

*   **Component A (e.g., Web Frontend):** [Responsibility description]
*   **Component B (e.g., API Gateway):** [Responsibility description]
*   **Component C (e.g., Authentication Service):** [Responsibility description]
*   **Component D (e.g., Order Processing Service):** [Responsibility description]
*   **Component E (e.g., Database):** [Responsibility description]

## 5. Data Management

*Describe the overall approach to data storage, management, and flow.*

*   **Primary Datastores:** [e.g., PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching, S3 for object storage]
*   **Data Flow:** [Brief description or diagram of how data moves between components]
*   **Data Schema Overview (Optional):** [Link to detailed schema or brief description]

## 6. Technology Stack

*List the key technologies, frameworks, languages, and platforms used in the system.*

*   **Frontend:** [e.g., React, TypeScript, Next.js]
*   **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js, Python (Flask/Django), Java (Spring Boot)]
*   **Databases:** [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis]
*   **Infrastructure:** [e.g., AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Docker, Kubernetes]
*   **Messaging:** [e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ]
*   **Monitoring:** [e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog]

## 7. Deployment View

*Describe how the system is deployed. Include key infrastructure components and environments.*

*   **Environments:** [e.g., Development, Staging, Production]
*   **Deployment Strategy:** [e.g., CI/CD using Jenkins/GitHub Actions, Blue/Green deployment]
*   **Infrastructure Overview:** [Diagram or description of servers, load balancers, network configuration]

## 8. Quality Attributes (Non-Functional Requirements)

*Discuss how the architecture addresses key quality attributes.*

*   **Scalability:** [Approach taken, e.g., horizontal scaling of services, load balancing]
*   **Reliability/Availability:** [Approach taken, e.g., redundancy, failover mechanisms, monitoring]
*   **Security:** [Approach taken, e.g., authentication/authorization methods, data encryption, network security]
*   **Maintainability:** [Approach taken, e.g., modular design, coding standards, documentation]
*   **Performance:** [Approach taken, e.g., caching strategies, asynchronous processing, database optimization]

## 9. Key Architectural Decisions

*Summarize or link to the most important architectural decisions made.*
